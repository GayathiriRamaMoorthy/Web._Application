                        Dubai  Gulf Arabic is the most populous city in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the capital of the Emirate of Dubai, the most populated of the 7 emirates of the United Arab Emirates.<br> Established in the 18th century as a small fishing village, the city grew rapidly in the early 21st century with a focus on tourism and luxury, having the second most five-star hotels in the world and the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa, which is 828 metres (2,717 ft) tall.[12]

                        In the eastern Arabian Peninsula on the coast of the Persian Gulf, it is also a major global transport hub for passengers and cargo. <br>Oil revenue helped accelerate the development of the city, which was already a major mercantile hub.<br> A centre for regional and international trade since the early 20th century, Dubai's economy relies on revenues from trade, tourism, aviation, real estate, and financial services. <br>Oil production contributed less than 1 percent of the emirate's GDP in 2018.<br> The city has a population of around 3.49 million (as of 2021).
